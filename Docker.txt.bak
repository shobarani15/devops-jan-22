Container 
	A container is a set of isolated processes and resources. Linux achieves 
	this by using namespaces, which allows processes to access only resources 
	in that particular namespace, which allows having a process tree means set 
	of processes that is completely independent of the rest of the systems processes.
	
	Docker definition: A container is a standard unit of software that packages 
	up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably 
	from one computing environment to another.

Docker 
	Docker is one of the tools that used the idea of the isolated resources to 
	create a container that allows applications to be packaged with all the 
	dependencies installed and ran wherever we wanted.
	
	Docker can only run on Linux machines this means I cant install Dokcer directly on Windows or any other OS.
	If I want install Docker on windows then I need to run a Linux VM in windows on top that I need to run Docker.

Virtualization (VM)
	- VM is way of running virtual OS on top a host OS using a special software called Hyperviser.
	- VM directly shares the harware of the host OS. 

					VM 					vs 			Containerisation 
	1. Virtualization at hardware level  		1. Virtualization at OS level 
	2. Heavyweight - consume more host 			2. Lightweight
	   resources 	
	3. VM useses hypervisor 					3. containerisation tool is used 
	4. limited performace - Boot up time        4. Native performace - usualy boot 
		is more which is in minutes 			   fast in seconds.
	5. Cosumes more storage 					5. Shres OS storage means only uses 
												   required storage.
	6. Supports all OS 							6. Supports on Linux

host machine 
	This is the machine in which docker is running 
	
Docker images 
	List images in a machine 
		docker images 
		
	To pull / download docker image 
		docker pull <image_name>:<tag_name>
			
		Note: if we wont specify tag the by default latest will be considered.	
		
	To delete docker image 
		docker rmi <image_name>:<tag_name>
					(OR)
		docker rmi <image_id>
		
	To delete all the images 
		docker rmi $(docker images -q)
		
	To tag a docker image
		docker tag <old_image> <new_image>
		
		ex: docker tag ubuntu:latest my_ubuntu:1.0
		
	To delete dangling images / to delete all unwanted images / images which are not used
		docker image prune 	
	
Docker containers 
	To create/run a container from image
		docker run -it -d --name <container_name> <image_name>
		
		-it - Interactive Terminal (tty) 
		-d - deatached mode (when ever we create a container it will auto login to avoid this 
			we can create a container in detached mode)
		--name used to provide user defined conatainer name
		
	To list the running containers 
		docker ps 
			(OR)
		docker container ls 	
		
	To delete a stop container 	
		docker rm <conatainer_name>
				(OR)
		docekr rm <conatainer_id>
		
	To delete a running container 
		Forceful deletion 
			docker rm -f <conatainer_id>
		Graceful deletion 
			docker rm $(docker stop <conatainer_id>)
			
	To list all the containers (running and stopped)
		docker ps -a 
	
	To list all stopped conatainers
		docker ps -a --filter status=exited
		
	To delete all stopped container
		docker rm $(docker ps -aq --filter status=exited)
		
	To check the logs of conatainers 
		docker logs <container_id>
		
	To run a command inside a conatainer 
		docker exec -it <container_id> <command>
		
	To login / get inside a containre 
		docker attach <container_id>
		
Assignment: work with docker commands
			Try to create a jenkins container (jenkins/jenkins:lts)
			
Custom Docker Image / Dockerfile 
	- Dockerfile is used to create custom image on top stock image or any other image as base image.
	
	FROM 
		- FROM must be the first non-command instruction in the Dockerfile.
		- FROM is used to specify the base image on top of this image all the next instructions will be executed.
		
		FROM <image_name>:<tag>
	 
	
	COPY and ADD 
		- Both copy and add instruction is used to copy files and directories from host machine to the image.
		- The source path to copy files should always be evaluted with reference to Dockerfile.
		
		ADD supports extra source formats 
			- If the source is a compressed file add will automatically 
			  uncompresses it to the destination.
			- If the source is a link to a downloadable file it will download 
			  to the destination.			  
			  
	CMD and ENTRYPOINT
		shell format 
			CMD "ls -lrt"
			ENTRYPOINT "ls -lrt"
			
		EXEC Format
			CMD ["ls","-l","-rt"]
			ENTRYPOINT ["ls","-lrt"]
			
		- Both CMD and ENTRYPOINT are used to define the execution command of the container which will be created 
		  from this image.
		- If we use multiple CMD or ENTRYPOINT in the same Dockerfile only the latest one will be considered 
		  and all the other CMD or ENTRYPOINT will be ignored.	
		- If we use both CMD and ENTRYPOINT in the same Dockerfile, ENTRYPOINT will get the 
		  higest priority and the command of CMD will become as argumetns to ENTRYPOINT	
		  
		 Difference  
		  -	CMD command can be overridden at the runtime.	
		  - ENTRYPOINT can't be overridden at the runtime but the runtime command
		    will become parameters to ENTRYPOINT command.
		  
		Note: Q. Can we override ENTRYPOINT 
				 Yes, after docker 1.6 version docker has given option to over
					  Entrypoint command at the runtime using --entrypoint 	
					  
	ENV 
		- This instruction is used to set the environment variable inside the container.
		
		ENV <variable_name> <value>
		ENV <variable_name>=<value>
		
		multiple 
		ENV <variable_name>=<value> <variable_name>=<value> <variable_name>=<value> ....
		
		To create environment variables at run time 
			- using -e or --env option at the runtime we can create env variables 
			- For multiple variables use multiple -e 

		ex:	docker run .... -e <variable_name>=<value> -e <variable_name>=<value> ....	
		
		The best way to load multiple env variable is using env file 
			using --env-file <file_path> at the runtime (with docker run command) we can 
			load the env file containing n number variables.	
			
	ARG
		Using ARG we can pass parameters to Dockerfile as user inputs 
			
		ARG <var_name>=<default_value>

		To pass the value at build time 
			docker build --build-arg <var_name>=<value> ....
	
	WORKDIR
		This is used to set the working directory for all the instructions that follows it
		such as RUN, CMD, ENTRYPOINT, COPY, ADD
		
		WORKDIR <path>

		
Docker Volumes
 	- As the layers inside the image are readonly which means once the image is created 
	  we cannot change/edit so we cannot put the conatainer data in image.
	- Container create a top most RW layer and all the runtime data is saved here. 
	- Container layer is temparary layer, If we loose the container we loose data. so
	  to retain/persist the container runtime data we need docker volumes.

	Bind Mounts 
		- we can mount host machine filesystem (files and directories) to the container
		
			docker run -v <host_path>:<container_path> 
	Docker Volumes		
		- These are docker managed filesystem and we use docker commands to manage these
		  volumes 
		- Volumes are easier to manage, backup or migrate than bind mounts.
		- Volumes supports many drivers which means we can maunt many types of filesystem.
		- Default location of docker volume is /var/lib/docker/volumes  	
		
		docker run -v <volume_name>:<container_path>
		
		To create volume 
			docker volume create <volume_name>
			
		To list volume 
			docker volume ls	
			
		To Delete volume 
			docker volume rm <volume_name>
