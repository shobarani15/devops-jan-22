Docker images 
	List images in a machine 
		docker images 
		
	To pull / download docker image 
		docker pull <image_name>:<tag_name>
			
		Note: if we wont specify tag the by default latest will be considered.	
		
	To delete docker image 
		docker rmi <image_name>:<tag_name>
					(OR)
		docker rmi <image_id>
		
	To delete all the images 
		docker rmi $(docker images -q)
		
	To tag a docker image
		docker tag <old_image> <new_image>
		
		ex: docker tag ubuntu:latest my_ubuntu:1.0
		
Docker containers 
	To create/run a container from image
		docker run -it -d --name <container_name> <image_name>
		
		-it - Interactive Terminal (tty) 
		-d - deatached mode (when ever we create a container it will auto login to avoid this 
			we can create a container in detached mode)
		--name used to provide user defined conatainer name
		
	To list the running containers 
		docker ps 
			(OR)
		docker container ls 	
		
	To delete a stop container 	
		docker rm <conatainer_name>
				(OR)
		docekr rm <conatainer_id>
		
	To delete a running container 
		Forceful deletion 
			docker rm -f <conatainer_id>
		Graceful deletion 
			docker rm $(docker stop <conatainer_id>)
			
	To list all the containers (running and stopped)
		docker ps -a 
	
	To list all stopped conatainers
		docker ps -a --filter status=exited
		
	To delete all stopped container
		docker rm $(docker ps -aq --filter status=exited)
		
	To check the logs of conatainers 
		docker logs <container_id>
		
	To run a command inside a conatainer 
		docker exec -it <container_id> <command>
		
	To login / get inside a containre 
		docker attach <container_id>
		
Assignment: work with docker commands
			Try to create a jenkins container (jenkins/jenkins:lts)
			
Custom Docker Image / Dockerfile 
	- Dockerfile is used to create custom image on top stock image or any other image as base image.
	
	FROM 
		- FROM must be the first non-command instruction in the Dockerfile.
		- FROM is used to specify the base image on top of this image all the next instructions will be executed.
		
		FROM <image_name>:<tag>
	
	COPY and ADD 
		- Both copy and add instruction is used to copy files and directories from host machine to the image.
		- The source path to copy files should always be evaluted with reference to Dockerfile.
		
		ADD supports extra source formats 
			- If the source is a compressed file add will automatically 
			  uncompresses it to the destination.
			- If the source is a link to a downloadable file it will download 
			  to the destination.			  
			  
	CMD and ENTRYPOINT
		shell format 
			CMD "ls -lrt"
			ENTRYPOINT "ls -lrt"
			
		EXEC Format
			CMD ["ls","-l","-rt"]
			ENTRYPOINT ["ls","-lrt"]
			
		- Both CMD and ENTRYPOINT are used to define the execution command of the container which will be created 
		  from this image.
		- If we use multiple CMD or ENTRYPOINT in the same Dockerfile only the latest one will be considered 
		  and all the other CMD or ENTRYPOINT will be ignored.	
		- If we use both CMD and ENTRYPOINT in the same Dockerfile, ENTRYPOINT will get the 
		  higest priority and the command of CMD will become as argumetns to ENTRYPOINT	
		  
		 Difference  
		  -	CMD command can be overridden at the runtime.	
		  - ENTRYPOINT can't be overridden at the runtime but the runtime command
		    will become parameters to ENTRYPOINT command.
		  
		Note: Q. Can we override ENTRYPOINT 
				 Yes, after docker 1.6 version docker has given option to over
					  Entrypoint command at the runtime using --entrypoint 	
					  
	ENV 
		- This instruction is used to set the environment variable inside the container.
		
		ENV <variable_name> <value>
		ENV <variable_name>=<value>
		
		multiple 
		ENV <variable_name>=<value> <variable_name>=<value> <variable_name>=<value> ....
		
		To create environment variables at run time 
			- using -e or --env option at the runtime we can create env variables 
			- For multiple variables use multiple -e 

		ex:	docker run .... -e <variable_name>=<value> -e <variable_name>=<value> ....	
		
		The best way to load multiple env variable is using env file 
			using --env-file <file_path> at the runtime (with docker run command) we can 
			load the env file containing n number variables.	
			
	ARG
		Using ARG we can pass parameters to Dockerfile as user inputs 
			
		ARG <var_name>=<default_value>

		
		To pass the value at build time 
			docker build --build-arg <var_name>=<value> ....
